Operate under your own risk.

Operate RC-Components like servos.

We created this piece to control an ESC. Still a Work in Progress.

Instructions for use with ESC
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wire the signal to Pin 11 (GPIO 17) on a Raspberry Pi B+ v1.2
Wire Black to GND
Ignore Red Cable (if using external Power Source)
Start sase.py before turning on the ESC (Servos are not affected)
Once you exit out of the Script you have to restart the ESC, too.
