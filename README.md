Operate two servos.

I used this Script in order to turn a mounted webcam on two achsis. 


!! Still a Work in Progress. !!
>>I still need to fix the positioning :)



Instructions for use as 2-achsis-platform
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wire the signal of the servo, responsible for vertical turning to Pin 11 (GPIO 17) on a Raspberry Pi B+ v1.2.
Wire the signal of the horizontal servo to Pin 13 (GPIO 27).

I used an external energy source and wired the black to minus and red to plus, providing both servos with 6Volt.
